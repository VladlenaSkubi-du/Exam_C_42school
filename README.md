# Exam_C_42school
Here you can find exercises of levels 4 and 5 that seemed difficult for me.

# Usage
If most of the exercises we had to write programs. So you need to enter a folder needed and compile the program:

	gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror [program name] [file.c name]

And then launch the program:

	./[program name] [arguments according to the subject]

If each folder you ca find subject in English.
If we had to write a function, there will be also main.c files in the folder needed.
So you do:

	gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror [program name] [file.c name] main.c

And then launch the program:

	./[program name]

Go and try!
