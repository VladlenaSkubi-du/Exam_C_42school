# Exam_C_42school
Here you can find exercises of levels 4 and 5 that seemed difficult for me.

# Usage
In most of the exercises we had to write programs. So you need to enter a folder needed and compile the program:

	gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror [program name] [file.c name]

And then launch the program:

	./[program name] [arguments according to the subject]

In each folder you can find a subject in English.
If we need to write a function, there is also a main.c file in the folder needed.
So you do:

	gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror [program name] [file.c name] main.c

And then launch the program:

	./[program name]

Go and try!
